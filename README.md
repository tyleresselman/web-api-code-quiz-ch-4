# Code Quiz - Challenge 4

# Description

The purpose of this challenge was to implement our new knowledge of Javascript to build a timed code quiz with multiple choice questions. Upon completion of the quiz, the user is meant to be able to see the score they achieved on the quiz, record their initials along with that score, and save that pair of items to a high score list saved in local storage. I achieved a few of these goals. I admittedly ran into several obstacles and my version of this app unfortunately does not check all the boxes. In addition to life events this week that prevented me from devoting as much time as would have been necessary to completing the whole brief, I also know for myself that I have work to do connecting the abstract concepts of Javascript functionality to actual practice. My plan for remedying that is improve my time management and study practice to get more bang ofr my buck while working. I intend to use targeted time with tutors to shore up my skill with Javascript and make sure I have a better action plan when presented with similar challenges in the future, both in this bootcamp and out in the world. In short, I intend to have a better plan next time for how to tackle this sort of code. I've got the tools, now I just need to make them mine.
